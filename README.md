# Apple Music Replica

This application is a proof of concept for imitating the Apple Music music controlling slider as seen in the images below.

The slider will respond to taps as well as drags, allowing the user to control the animating directly.

The slider is added as a subview to a container view which houses the usual UI interface. We can fix the slider to the bottom of the window by using a container view to display the app's content.

## Animation Features

- As the slider appears, the main UI's view will darken
- The album artwork inside of the slider will adjust to match the size of the slider throughout the animation
- The slider is tappable or draggable
- The slider will detect the velocity of a drag to determine its final location
